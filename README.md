## Description

We created an adoption website for pets. There are 3 different types of pets. The different types of pets include dogs, cats, and dino's. There are 4 buttons on the top of the page that sort each type of pets. When you select the dino's button, you will only see the dino's displayed to the page. When you select the cats button, you will only see the cats displayed to the page. When you select the dogs button, you will only see the dogs displayed to the page. When you select the all button, all of the pets will display on the page. The type of animal at the bottom of the card should match each button color. The card contains the name, color, special skill, type, and image.
